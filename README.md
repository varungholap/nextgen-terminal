# Nextgen-terminal A smarter Terminal for Operating Systems
OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of this project is to create an advanced next generation easy-to-use voice activated terminal, that has conventional functionalities of a terminal and highly advanced functionalities too.
We are planning to do these by integrating Core OS principles and programming with modern API Cloud tools and Cloud Computing for Speech Recognition for High Performance Fast Terminal.

This project proposes integration of modern Artificial Intelligence concepts to Operating System concepts in order to provide a much efficient and smarter result to provide the enhancement to common functionalities with additional operations too .

INTRODUCTION:

The scope of this project is to create a complete smarter functioning Operating System, and this could be used to help amateur programmers start of with the field of Computer Science.We also plan to make this project help the differently abled  by helping them use their own systems in a much simpler way thereby making it better.
